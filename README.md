## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this small project I had the opportunity to learn and practice the basics of CSS Grid Layout.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning and practicing CSS Grid Layout, Flexbox too, and all CSS properties in general. I also want to continue training my writing in HTML semantics to lay a solid foundation before I start learning JavaScript to create more complex websites.
